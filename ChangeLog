	* land slides no longer buggy (used to duplicate land)
	* land is heavier than water
	* generating terrain notice
	* weapon energy
	@ dostuff rewritten to use struct Tasks * table and run things every # ms

	* land slides sidewise too now
	@ added unsigned int tm into strcut lndpts
	@ added him_getnow() into paint (in SDL uses GetTicks, in vga uses gettimeofday(2))
	* land is more random after explosion


0.6 -> 0.7	(07/14/2004)

main - eliminated the "explosion on the border of screen hangs up the
       whole game" bug
     - added real-looking (almost) lightning
     - land slides down

water - water behaves (ALMOST - see README and grep BUG) properly now

paint - water and clouds are transparent (~50%) when there's sun or moon behind

paintSDL - uses SDL_Surfaces for layers
    


0.5 -> 0.6	(once)

paint - added him_ufullcircler
main - realtime shooting (, changed keys, multiple explosions)

moved raw keyboard to paint*

paintSDL - created => tankSDL
