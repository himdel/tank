2010
	* merged 0.8a, 0.8e and a 0.8a fork, but not the 0.8d debug stuff, some changes here are not in the code

	* added scripts/tgz.sh

2005-08-27 00:04:34:	himdel
//	* fixed the debug trace system:
//	* some functions didnt call debug_add but did _out, so we used to forget where we are
//	* changed the format of trace dump to func per line and added number
//	* added warnings about debug_out&add count mismatch

2005-08-26 21:46:42:	himdel
//	* -DDEBUG no longer in Makefiles but in debug.h
//	* that way you controll everything by just including debug.h or 

2005-08-23 19:38:23:	himdel
//	* tank-0.8d released - a debug release
//	@ debug.[ch] added
//	* -DDEBUG in Makefiles
//	* each func has debug_add(NAME) and debug_out - don't forget to call BEFORE return

2005-08-20 22:44:30:	himdel

	* land slides sidewise too now
	@ added unsigned int tm into strcut lndpts
	@ added him_getnow() into paint (in SDL uses GetTicks, in vga uses gettimeofday(2))
	* land is more random after explosion


0.6 -> 0.7	(07/14/2004)

main - eliminated the "explosion on the border of screen hangs up the
       whole game" bug
     - added real-looking (almost) lightning
     - land slides down

water - water behaves (ALMOST - see README and grep BUG) properly now

paint - water and clouds are transparent (~50%) when there's sun or moon behind

paintSDL - uses SDL_Surfaces for layers
    


0.5 -> 0.6	(once)

paint - added him_ufullcircler
main - realtime shooting (, changed keys, multiple explosions)

moved raw keyboard to paint*

paintSDL - created => tankSDL
