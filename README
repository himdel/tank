tank

A real-time tank-shooting game with two tanks, for SDL and svgalib.

Originally written on a i486 notebook (33MHz, 8 MB RAM) running Linux (kernel 2.4.26, egcs-2.90.29, libc5), needs about 16MB of memory.

Contributions are of course very welcome.

So far, the only contribution was the contrib/TNKb.png file (converted
from the .gif original by me) from Petr Schreiber. Thanks!

Layers (8):
0 - stars & sun & moon
1 - land & water
2 - clouds
3 - rain
5 - tanks
6 - shots and lightning
7 - arrows, text
